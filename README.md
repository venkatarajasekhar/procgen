procgen
=======

Testbed for procedural generation ideas: allows procedural textures, meshes, and scenes. A constant work in progress.

Only tested to work on debian based linuxes (Mint and Ubuntu are common test distributions)

To see how things work, check out the procedural.cpp, and the procscene-stest.lua in the data folder. I've not even split the code into multiple files yet, so it's quite easy to read in a single web page and with search at the moment.
